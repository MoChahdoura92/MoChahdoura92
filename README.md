# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mohamed !

## I'm a Web Developer and computer science's master program Student. 

I recently moved from Switzerland to Ottawa. 
I've always been interrested in developping web platforms and motivated in learning new dev tools.
During Covid-19, I decided to take a new challenge for the master degree in Canada , the University of Quebec in Outaouais.
I'm excited to make a positive impact on the world, one line of code at a time!
